## Covid Report
Well, it looks like all the work was already done for me from the Github link itself. Thus, the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`.

I then modified the `Analysis.R` file to include pretty numbers for the total deaths.

Chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
